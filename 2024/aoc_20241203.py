I didn't know any regex so I wrote a hacky solution at first. Then, I looked up
some regex documentation and wrote a much better regex solution at the bottom.

"""
When I saw the problem, I knew that putting off learning regex was finally catching
up to me. But, for time, I wasn't sure if making a hacky solution would be faster
than learning regex.

# %% regex soultion
"""
I decided I should learn some regex. It wasn't that bad. I guess I'm used to seeing
really complicated regex. Turns out learning regex for this would have been faster
that making my hacky solution, haha. If I had the time, I could probably improve the
below, but good enough.
